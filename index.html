      <h2 class="section-title">The Story of the Founder</h2>
      <p class="content">
        FoodBird App was launched by a former shortheight lightweight WWE wrestling champion of Lallaguda Mr.Danny Perimala Lazrus. Danny has stumbled upon this idea when he was getting weary of his 9-5 wrestling role. After gazing upon the majestic Swiggy and Zomato apps which have acquired the mass market, Danny decided that he was going to put an end to their legacy by starting this revolutionary Food Delivery App. Danny is set to change the course of Food delivery by integrating his hardcore experience he had gained from his wrestling career into this new found passion. He is moved by innovation and free enterprise and saw an opportunity to marry society’s demand for faster, more flexible dining options to underutilized riders on their bikes through an on-demand market by making the FoodBird App. Please watch out for this ex-wrestling champion to transform the course of human destiny.
